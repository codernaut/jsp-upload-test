# jsp-upload-test
While working on a second project in official job, team was stuck at uploading and downloading a file using jsp and servlets
There they had to fill an enhancement request to give the facility of uploading and downloading a file.
So made a small test project to demonstrate one possible way of doing that
it expects a single table by the name of new_table and single column of type blob
